Dear All,

Take the TensorFlow (basic) implementation of Autoencoders on the Fashion MNIST dataset. (see attached file). Try to improve the performance (measured on the validation dataset) of the model by the following approaches:
a) Varying the number of layers and units in the layers
b) Employing regularization
c) Corrupting the inputs with some noise

Deadline: October 17, 2020
Submissions are to be made by replying to this email with files as attachments or as a GoogleDrive link. 

Best wishes,
Dripta Mj

Hint:
b) from tensorflow.keras import regularizers
layers.Dense(50, activation='relu', activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(10e-5))
